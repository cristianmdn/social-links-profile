## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a simple project but I learned about the focus state and the tabindex attribute. I deciced to just make it look as close as possible to the given design. I don't really care too much about adding my personal colors palette and all that. I just want to learn as much as I can and practice what matters the most.
